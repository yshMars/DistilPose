# Introdoction
In the field of human pose estimation, regression-based methods have been dominated in terms of speed, while heatmap-based methods are far ahead in terms of performance. How to take advantage of both schemes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel human pose estimation framework termed ***DistilPose***, which *bridges the gaps between heatmap-based and regression-based methods*.
