# Introdoction
In the field of human pose estimation, regression-based methods have been dominated in terms of speed, while heatmap-based methods are far ahead in terms of performance. How to take advantage of both schemes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel human pose estimation framework termed ***DistilPose***, which *bridges the gaps between heatmap-based and regression-based methods*.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
- We propose a novel human pose estimation framework, ***DistilPose***, which is *the first work to transfer knowledge between heatmap-based and regression-based models losslessly*.
- We introduce a novel **Token-distilling Encoder (TDE)** to take advantage of both heatmap-based and regression-based models. With the proposed TDE, the gap between the output space of heatmaps and coordinate vectors can be facilitated in a tokenized manner.
- We propose **Simulated Heatmaps** to model explicit heatmap information, including 2D keypoint distributions and keypoint confidences. With the aid of Simulated Heatmaps, we can transform the regression-based HPE task into a more straightforward learning task that fully exploits local information. Simulated Heatmaps can be applied to any heatmap-based and regression-based models for transferring heatmap knowledge to regression models.
